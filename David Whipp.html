  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="why-google-sites">Why Google Sites?</h2>
<p>I’ve had <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dwhipp">my Google Sites page</a> since 2009, and generally it has been good to me.
After my University of Michigan website was taken down in late 2008 or early 2009, I migrated to Google Sites because it was new, free, and easy to maintain.
My previous websites had been written in html, requiring files to be downloaded, edited, and uploaded in order to update content or add a new page.
Google Sites allowed content to be created and edited online using a web browser, which I hoped would mean I could keep my website up to date more easily.
In addition, as a postdoc with plans to be moving to multiple academic institutions, I wanted a somewhat permanent webspace to provide basic contact info that would have time to rise in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Google PageRank</a>.</p>

<h2 id="some-of-the-issues">Some of the issues</h2>
<p>Although Google Sites has been reliable and allowed me to attract &gt;100 people per day via Google traffic, there are significant limitations in terms of what can be done with a Google Site.
The main sources of frustration for me were that text formatting is limited, meaning that it is not easy to have automatic syntax highlighting for code snippets and it is difficult to display equations.
There are some <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sachinkagarwal/home/code-snippets/code-syntax-highlighting-in-google-sites">tricks regarding syntax highlighting</a>, equation options are quite limited since javascript is not allowed, preventing things like <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> from being used.
This lack of javascript support also means that it is not possible to take full advantage of web tracking systems like <a href="https://statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a>, limiting what I can see about my site traffic.
<a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> is available, but I like the interface available from StatCounter a bit better, so that was annoying.
Lastly, I found that I was often able to produce a decent looking Google Site, but there were frequently things that I would like to have changed in the page layout.
The simplicity of Google Sites is great, but if you like to be able to dig in and modify things to look the way you like, you will have issues.
Thus, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dwhipp/">my Google Site</a> became something I kept around but did not update, and it has now become an ugly attempt to create a fixed-width font, coding-inspired site using the <a href="https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/">base16 eighties dark</a> color scheme.
It has not been a success.</p>

<h2 id="why-github-pages">Why GitHub Pages?</h2>
<p>It is true that there are plenty of options for hosting webpages, but I opted to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for several reasons.
First, GitHub Pages is a free service like Google Sites, but it simply provides a webserver for files you would like to host.
Thus, you’re free to create a simply HTML-based page by hand, or use a more sophisticated platform based on well-designed templates available online.
Second, I have been using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> quite a bit recently for teaching courses on <a href="https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people">programming</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-Quantitative-Geology">quantitative geoscience</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/IntroGM">geodynamic modelling</a>.
I have become quite familiar with producing documents in GitHub repositories using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, and I figured that if I was able to find some kind of template that I liked for GitHub Pages (they have <a href="https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages">several options available by default</a>) then I could produce my page content in Markdown, but have it nicely rendered as a webpage using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
Unfortunately, I don’t really care for the available GitHub Pages themes, so I needed to track down a Jekyll theme I liked that could easily be hosted on GitHub Pages.
If nothing in the previous two sentences made any sense to you, simply know that I was looking for a nice looking website template in which it was easy to add content.
Lastly, I’ve begun using GitHub Pages for some of the courses I teach (<a href="https://introgm.github.io/">example</a>), so I already had a pretty good sense of what could be done and how to get started.
Thus, the new page was born.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>So, as I said in my first post on the new page, here we are.
I’m hopeful that I will enjoy adding material to my new site and keep it a bit more up to date than my now decrepit Google Site.
I am pleased so far with the appearance and flexibility of the <a href="https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids">Leonids Jekyll theme</a> I’m using, and I think GitHub Pages might finally provide a semi-permanent webspace with the flexibility I’ve been seeking.
Time will tell…</p>
